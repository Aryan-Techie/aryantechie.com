**Day before yesterday, creator of Once-UI from Europe sent me a $50 gift out of nowhere.**

I'd been contributing to their project recently and have a pretty good connection with them. Then completely out of left field - a $50 gift shows up in my inbox. I was buzzing! Something about unexpected generosity just hits different.

But then reality hit: I might have to pay customs fees that could end up costing me.
So now I'm hanging in this weird limbo. Will I pay fees? Will I not? The gift could end up costing me money. The surprise could become a little problem.

And you know what? **I'm fascinated by this.**

Most people would be stressed right now. Planning, googling customs rules, trying to figure out the "right" move. But I'm just... curious. Because this is exactly how life works, and I think I'm starting to love it.

## The Double Pendulum Theory of Life

You know what a double pendulum is? It's two pendulums attached to each other. You can predict where a single pendulum will swing, but add that second pendulum? Chaos.

The smallest change in starting position creates completely different patterns. Even if you know all the physics, all the math, all the variables - you still can't predict where it'll end up after a few swings.

**That's your life.**

You can control your initial conditions - your actions, your choices, your effort. But you can't predict the outcomes because there are too many other pendulums swinging around you. Other people's decisions. Random events. Economic shifts. A global pandemic. Someone deciding to send you a gift card.

Most people spend their entire lives trying to predict the unpredictable. They make five-year plans like they're the only pendulum in the system. They stress about outcomes they can't control. They think they're the center of the universe.

But here's the truth that nobody wants to hear: **You're not.**

## The Expectation Trap

I wrote about this before - how happiness comes from reality minus expectations. But there's something deeper here.

When I expected nothing from that contribution I made months ago, getting $50 felt amazing. Pure dopamine hit. But the moment I started expecting to keep all $50, the possibility of customs fees felt like losing money.

Same gift. Different expectations. Completely different emotional experience.

This is why unexpected rewards always feel better than expected ones. It's not just about the money or the recognition - it's about the surprise breaking through your prediction patterns.

Your brain is constantly trying to model the future. When reality exceeds those models, you get a hit of satisfaction. When it falls short, you get disappointment. The feeling isn't about the outcome - it's about the gap between prediction and reality.

**The less you expect, the more life can surprise you.**

## Why Everyone is Scared (And Why That's Backwards)

Here's what I notice about most people: they're terrified of uncertainty. They want guarantees, safety nets, predictable outcomes. They'll choose a boring but stable path over an exciting but uncertain one every time.

And I get it. Uncertainty feels dangerous because our brains evolved when uncertainty often meant death. Unknown sounds in the bushes could be predators. Uncertain food sources could mean starvation.

But we're not in the bushes anymore.

**Modern uncertainty isn't dangerous - it's where opportunities hide.**

The people who stay in jobs they hate because it's "safe." The ones who never travel because they can't plan every detail. The ones who avoid starting projects because they can't guarantee success.

They think they're protecting themselves, but they're actually limiting themselves. They're choosing the illusion of control over the reality of possibility.

## The Art of Surfing Chaos

I used to think successful people were good at controlling outcomes. But the more I observe, the more I realize they're just better at surfing uncertainty.

Take my relationship (and no, I'm not getting into specifics - not everything needs to become a blog post, you know?). But here's what I will say: the moments I stopped trying to control every interaction, stopped analyzing every text message, stopped planning every conversation - that's when things got actually good.

**Not because I gave up caring, but because I gave up the illusion that I could control how someone else thinks and feels.**

Or my work. The projects I planned meticulously often fail. The ones that succeed usually come from unexpected directions. Someone sees something I built, mentions it to someone else, who happens to need exactly that thing at exactly that moment.

You can't plan for that. You can only position yourself to catch those waves when they come.

## The Physics of Not Being the Center

Here's the hardest truth: you're a single pendulum in a system of billions.

Your decisions matter - they absolutely do. But they're not the only decisions that matter. Your timeline isn't the only timeline. Your problems aren't the only problems.

This isn't nihilistic. It's liberating.

When you accept that you're not the center of the universe, you stop taking everything personally. Market crashes, delayed flights, people not responding to your messages - it's not about you. It's just chaos being chaos.

But when good things happen - unexpected opportunities, random kindness, lucky breaks - you can appreciate them without feeling like you "deserved" them or need to maintain them forever.

## Life is a Game, Not a Test

Most people treat life like a test they need to pass. There's a right answer, and if they study hard enough, plan enough, optimize enough, they'll get it right.

**But life isn't a test. It's a game.**

Games have rules, but they also have randomness. You can get better at playing, but you can't guarantee you'll win every round. The fun isn't in knowing the outcome - it's in seeing how you respond to whatever the game throws at you. It's in the process.

In tests, uncertainty means you don't know the answer. In games, uncertainty means anything could happen next.

I choose to see life as a game. Even when I get depressed (and I do - I'm not immune to mental health struggles), I remember: this too shall pass. Bad streaks end. Good streaks end too. The game keeps going.

## What Changes When You Stop Fighting

When you stop trying to control uncertainty and start surfing it instead:

• **You take more risks** because you're not attached to specific outcomes. You're curious about what might happen, not terrified of what could go wrong.

• **You get less disappointed** because you expect less from any individual outcome. You're playing a longer game.

• **You notice more opportunities** because you're not tunnel-visioned on your original plan. You're open to paths you didn't see coming.

• **You become more interesting** because uncertainty forces you to adapt, and adaptation creates character.

• **You stress less** because you accept that most things are outside your control anyway.

## The Customs Fee Update

By the time you read this, I'll probably know whether I have to pay customs fees for that gift. Maybe I will, maybe I won't. Maybe the fees will be ₹0, maybe ~₹2500.

Honestly? I'm excited to find out.

Not because I want to pay fees, but because I'm curious how this particular pendulum swing will land. Will the gift end up costing me money? Will it be exactly what I expected? Will there be some third option I never considered?

**The uncertainty is the interesting part.**

## Your Turn to Surf

Here's what I want you to try: for the next week, catch yourself every time you try to control an outcome you can't actually control.

Refreshing your email hoping for a response. Planning exactly how a conversation should go. Worrying about what people think of your latest post. Trying to force a decision out of someone else.

Just notice it. Don't judge yourself for it. Just observe: "Oh, I'm trying to control a pendulum that's not mine to swing."

Then ask: "What would happen if I got curious about this instead of stressed about it?"

Maybe nothing changes. Maybe everything does.

**The beautiful part is you won't know until you try.**

And that uncertainty? That's not a bug in the system.

That's the whole fucking point.

*Life keeps surprising me, and I'm starting to think that's exactly how it should be. What's the most uncertain thing in your life right now? Instead of trying to control it, what would happen if you got curious about it instead?*

*Also, I'll update you on those customs fees. Because honestly, it's not that big deal but, I'm dying to know how this story ends too.*

Peace.
