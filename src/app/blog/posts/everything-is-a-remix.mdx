**I made a video about music addiction that felt completely original.**

[The video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9-aQVwntyU) was about how music amplifies your emotional state, how we use it to escape silence, how it creates dependency. I talked about my own struggle with being unable to walk, work out, or exist without constant audio stimulation. How I was scared of being alone with my thoughts. How stopping music transformed my focus and forced me to face myself.

When I hit publish, I felt something rare: "Damn!, this is genuinely original."

But here's the thing - it wasn't.

I know for a fact this idea came from things I'd consumed recently. Books I'd read. Podcasts I'd listened to. Videos I'd watched. The David Goggins quote about music being "cheating" during workouts. The concept of silence as a practice.

I just couldn't point to the exact sources anymore. The influences had blended together so thoroughly that the output felt like mine.

**And that's when I realized: that's exactly what originality actually is.**

## The Lie We Tell Ourselves

Most people think originality means creating something from nothing. Pure invention. A spark of genius untouched by influence.

It's bullshit.

French writer Andr√© Gide put it perfectly: "Everything that needs to be said has already been said. But since no one was listening, everything must be said again."

Or even better - William Ralph Inge's definition: "What is originality? Undetected plagiarism."

Nothing comes from nowhere. Every idea you've ever had is a mashup of things you consumed, experiences you lived, and patterns your brain connected. **You are the sum of your influences.**

The book "Steal Like an Artist" destroyed and rebuilt my understanding of creativity in one sentence: "When people call something original, nine out of ten times they just don't know the references or the original sources involved."

There is nothing new under the sun. There never was.

## The Ashes Origin Story

Let me show you how this actually works in practice.

I was watching a YouTube video when I noticed something on the wall behind the creator - a poster covered in weird dots. My curiosity kicked in (more on this later): What the fuck is that?

Down the rabbit hole I went. Turned out to be a Memento Mori calendar - a visual reminder that you're going to die. Each dot represents a week of your life. You fill one in every week. It slaps you in the face with mortality and makes time feel precious.

I loved it. Printed my own. Stuck it on my wall.

And then... I forgot about it. Who has time to fill in dots every week?

But the idea stuck. Most of my work happens in front of a screen, so why not make it a browser extension? I searched for existing solutions. Found a few. None of them felt right.

So I built [Ashes](https://ashes.aroice.in/). A new tab page that shows you your life in weeks, reminds you that you're not immortal, and makes every moment feel more present.

**Was this original?**

No. Memento Mori is ancient philosophy. Life calendars exist. Browser extensions exist. Death reminders exist.

**Was it mine?**

Absolutely.

Because no one else would have built it exactly that way. No one else had my specific combination of:

* Seeing that poster
* Getting curious about it
* Trying the physical version
* Forgetting to use it
* Spending most of my time in a browser
* Having the skills to build an extension
* Caring enough to actually do it

The idea was remixed from dozens of sources. But the execution? That could only come from me.

## The Curiosity Engine

Here's what nobody talks about: **originality doesn't come from trying to be original. It comes from being curious.**

I've been a curious person since I was a kid. 5th to 7th grade, nobody taught me how to use computers. I just... figured it out. Read documentation. Googled problems. Browsed Reddit forums. Now it's the AI boom, but the pattern is the same.

I learn because I want to know. Not because I'm trying to create something groundbreaking.

And this is where our generation is getting fucked.

I see parents shouting at their kids for asking "why." I understand it - sometimes they don't know the answer themselves. But saying "I don't know" is better than shutting down curiosity. Because humans are fundamentally curious beings. That's why we went from the Stone Age to the digital era.

**Kill curiosity, and you kill the only engine that drives real creation.**

When I got curious about those dots on the wall, I wasn't trying to build a product. I was just following the thread. The creation came later, almost as a side effect.

## What "Original" Actually Means

A good artist understands that nothing comes from nowhere. All creative work builds on what came before. Nothing is completely original - not even this blog you're reading right now.

But here's what makes something feel original: **your personal lens.**

Every remix gets filtered through your experiences, your struggles, your specific way of connecting dots. When I made that music video, I wasn't the first person to notice that music shapes emotional states. But it felt original because it came through:

* My addiction to constant audio
* My fear of silence
* My specific struggle to sit with my thoughts
* My journey of breaking free from it

That's the essence of originality - not inventing from nothing, but expressing something only you could express in exactly that way.

## What We're Actually Losing

If a generation never develops "original thoughts," we're not losing truth or ideas - those are always circulating, always being remixed.

**We're losing authentic voice.**

We'd still have content, products, inventions. But they'd be hollow. Copy-paste machines with no inner necessity driving them.

What's lost isn't innovation - it's depth. The courage to say: "This is how the world looks through my eyes."

Originality isn't about being first. It's about being true.

And if a generation abandons that? We end up with progress without soul. Creation without meaning.

## The Paralysis Problem

Here's the real danger: telling people to "be original" actually freezes them.

It sets an impossible standard - as if originality means creating something untouched by influence. But nothing is born in a vacuum. Every idea is stitched together from what we've read, seen, lived, and felt.

The "be original" mantra paralyzes people before they even start:

* "Has this been done before?"
* "Am I just copying?"
* "What if someone calls me out for not being original?"

So instead of creating, they stay silent.

**This is backwards.**

## The Better Way

Stop trying to be original. Start being honest and curious.

Remix what resonates with you. Follow the threads that make you ask "why?" Let your experiences, your scars, your quirks leak into whatever you're making.

If you do that, originality becomes a byproduct, not a goal.

Your perspective will make it yours. Not because you invented something from nothing, but because your specific combination of influences and experiences can't be replicated.

Here's what actually works:

1. **Feed Your Curiosity** - Consume widely. Read books outside your field. Watch videos that aren't about your industry. Talk to people who think differently. Your brain needs raw material to remix.

2. **Follow Your "Wait, What?" Moments** - When something catches your attention - a weird poster, a strange concept, an unexpected connection - don't ignore it. That's your curiosity engine firing. Follow it.

3. **Make Things Your Way** - Don't ask "has this been done?" Ask "have I done this?" Your version will be different because you're different.

4. **Document Your Process** - When you create something, track where the influences came from. Not to prove originality, but to understand your own remix process. It's fascinating to see how dots connect.

5. **Stop Waiting for Permission** - You don't need a completely novel idea to start. Start with something that exists and make it yours. That's literally how every great thing was built.

## The Truth About Influences

You are shaped and fashioned by what you love. That's not a weakness - it's how humans work.

When I built Ashes, I wasn't trying to hide the fact that Memento Mori calendars exist. I linked to them. I celebrated the concept. Because the goal isn't to pretend you invented everything - it's to take what resonates and make something only you would make.

**The best creators are obvious about their influences.** They steal openly. They give credit. They show their work.

Because they understand: originality isn't about being first. It's about being authentic.

## What This Means for You

Stop measuring yourself by whether your ideas are "original." That's not the game.

The real questions are:

* Are you curious enough to keep exploring?
* Are you honest enough to express what you actually think?
* Are you brave enough to share your specific lens on old ideas?

If yes to all three, you're already doing the work.

Your remix will be unique because you made it. Your voice will be original because it's yours.

**The world doesn't need more completely novel ideas. It needs more people willing to say old truths in new ways, through their own lived experience.**

Because as Gide said - everything's been said before. But we keep needing to hear it again.

## Your Turn

Here's what I want you to try:

Take one idea you love - a concept from a book, a quote you saved, a video that changed your thinking. Now ask yourself: what's my personal connection to this? How does this look through my specific life experience?

Write about that. Build something around that. Create your version of it.

Don't worry about whether it's been done. It has. Everything has.

**Worry about whether it's been done by you.**

Because that's the only kind of originality that actually matters.

*Everything I wrote here is remixed from books I read, videos I watched, and experiences I lived. The specific combination? That's mine. And that's enough.*

*What are you curious about right now? 
Follow that thread. See where it goes. Your remix is waiting.*

Peace.
