## The Addiction I Didn't See Coming ðŸ’€

Last week, I was cleaning out my notes app when I noticed something weird. I had three different lists: "Goals for 2023," "Goals for 2024," and my draft "Goals for 2025."
In that list many were almost identical.

Same dreams, same ambitions, same "this year will be different" energy. But here I was, two years later, still hoping instead of doing.

That's when it hit me: I wasn't goal-setting. I was hope-dealing.

## The Beautiful Lie We Tell Ourselves

Hope feels so pure, so positive, so necessary. We're taught that hopeful people are the good ones â€” optimistic, resilient, forward-thinking. But I've discovered something uncomfortable about hope that nobody talks about.

Hope can become a substitute for action. A drug that makes you feel better about your situation without actually changing it.

Think about it: How many times have you felt genuinely good about your future just by imagining it? How many problems have you "solved" in your head while doing absolutely nothing about them in reality?

**The Hope Cycle I Got Trapped In:**
- Feel dissatisfied with current situation
- Imagine a better future version of myself
- Get dopamine hit from the fantasy
- Feel temporarily satisfied
- Return to same behaviors because the "solution" felt real

## The Morning I Stopped Believing in Tomorrow

Three months ago, I was having breakfast when my friend asked me about a project I'd been "working on" for over a year. As I started explaining my latest plan for it, I heard myself say the same words I'd said six months earlier.

"I'm really going to focus on it this quarter."
"I just need to get organized first."
"Once things settle down, I'll have more time."

My friend just nodded politely, but I could see it in her eyesâ€”the same look you give someone who keeps promising to quit smoking while lighting another cigarette.

Thatâ€™s when it hit me - I wasnâ€™t chasing my dreams, I was chasing the dopamine of planning them. 

Hope was my drug, and planning became my ritual.

## The Uncomfortable Truth About Optimism

Here's what I learned: there are two types of hope. One that energizes you toward action, and one that replaces the need for action entirely.

The first type says: "Things can get better, so let me do something about it."
The second type says: "Things will get better, so I don't need to do anything about it."

I'd been living on the second type for years, getting high off possibilities while my actual life stayed exactly the same.

**Signs You Might Be Hope-Addicted:**
- You feel better after making plans than after taking action
- Your future self is always more disciplined than your present self
- You get excited about new strategies but bored with execution
- You constantly restart instead of continuing
- Your goals stay the same year after year

## The Reality Check That Changed Everything

I realized that hope had been protecting me from disappointment by keeping everything hypothetical. As long as my dreams stayed in the future, they couldn't fail in the present.

But here's the catch: they also couldn't succeed.

The gap between who I was and who I wanted to be wasn't a problem to be solved with better hoping, it was a gap to be closed with consistent action, even when that action felt small and unglamorous.

**What I Discovered:**
- Present action beats future intention every time
- Small consistent steps outperform big hopeful leaps
- Discomfort is data, not something to hope away
- Your current self is your only real resource

## The Antidote to Hope Addiction

Instead of asking "What do I hope will happen?" I started asking "What can I do right now with what I have?"

Instead of visualizing my ideal future, I started paying attention to my actual present. What was I doing right now? What was I avoiding? What small thing could I change today?

This wasn't about giving up on dreams, it was about stopping the cycle of using dreams as an excuse to avoid reality.

**Ask Yourself:**
- What am I hoping for that I could actually start today?
- What problem am I fantasizing about solving instead of solving?
- Where am I using future motivation to avoid present discomfort?
- What would I do if hope wasn't an option?

## The Simple Challenge

For the next week, try this: Every time you catch yourself hoping, planning, or fantasizing about the future, ask yourself: "What's the tiniest version of this I could do right now?"

Not because these tiny actions will change your life, but because they'll break the pattern of using hope as a substitute for living.

## What I Know Now

Hope isn't evil, but it becomes dangerous when it replaces action. The most hopeful thing you can do isn't to believe in a better future, it's to create one through your choices today.

Your future self isn't coming to save you. They're waiting for you to start becoming them right now, with whatever imperfect action you can take in this imperfect moment at the end we are imperfect being.

and this is not just about goals!

Stop hoping. Start doing. The present is the only place where change actually happens.
