I'm writing this with a heavy chest and foggy mind, so forgive me if the words don't come out perfectly.

Right now, I'm sitting with feelings that don't have names. The kind that make your body feel both empty and too full at the same time. The kind that make you understand why people say heartbreak is physical, because it fuckin is.

But here's what I keep telling myself, even when I don't want to hear it: this feeling, as intense and overwhelming as it is right now, is temporary.

## The Gravity of This Moment

Whatever you're carrying today: grief, anxiety, that weird hollow feeling when something important ends, or even the opposite, that manic happiness when everything seems perfect, it feels permanent. It feels like this is just who you are now.

Your brain tricks you into thinking the current emotion is your new reality. When you're sad, you can't remember what happy felt like. When you're anxious, calm seems impossible. When you're angry, peace feels like a foreign concept.

But emotions are weather, not climate. They pass through you, not over you.

I've been trying to remember the last time I felt completely destroyed by something. I know it happened, I know there were nights I thought I'd never sleep peacefully again, days I thought I'd never laugh the same way. But I can barely recall what that felt like now, because it passed.

This will pass too.

## The Cruel Reality of Impermanence

Here's the part nobody wants to hear: the good feelings are temporary too.

That rush when someone texts you back. That high when you accomplish something you're proud of. That warm feeling when you're surrounded by people who love you. That moment when everything clicks and life feels meaningful.

None of it lasts.

This isn't pessimism, it's reality. And somehow, accepting this makes both the pain and the joy more bearable. The pain because you know it will ease. The joy because you know to pay attention while it's here.

Nine years can end in a conversation. A lifetime of shared jokes can become memories you carry alone. The person who knew all your stories can become someone you have to explain yourself to all over again, with someone new, someday.

But the love you felt? That was real. The happiness you shared? That happened. The growth that came from it? That stays with you.

## Lessons in Letting Go and Holding On

Right now, part of me wants to freeze in this feeling, not because it feels good, but because it's the last connection to something that mattered. Like if I stop hurting, I'm somehow betraying what we had.

But holding onto pain isn't loyalty. It's just holding onto pain.

Remember thoughts are also temporary. They feel true right now, but they're just thoughts, not facts.

## The Strange Comfort of Impermanence

When you really understand that everything is temporary, including this feeling, something shifts. Not immediately. Not dramatically. But gradually, like your eyes adjusting to darkness.

The unbearable becomes bearable because you know it won't be unbearable forever.

The beautiful becomes more precious because you know it won't be beautiful forever.

You stop clinging so tightly to both the good and the bad, because you know your grip doesn't determine how long they stay anyway.

**This too shall pass** isn't just something people say to comfort you. It's the most honest thing anyone can tell you about being human.

## What Remains After the Feeling Fades

I don't know how long this feeling will last. Days, weeks, months, I have no idea about it. But I know it will change. It has to, because that's what feelings do.

I also know that trying to rush through it or avoid it just makes it stick around longer. Some emotions need to be felt completely before they're willing to leave.

So I'm trying to sit with this without making it mean more than it means. It's not evidence that I'm broken or that love is pointless or that I'll never feel whole again. It's just what happens when something important ends.

Dear reader, whatever you're feeling right now the heartbreak, the anxiety, the loneliness, or even the overwhelming joy, remember it's temporary. Not because someone said so, but because that's how feelings work.

They come. They stay for a while. They change. They leave.

And somehow, that's both the saddest and most hopeful thing about being human.

*This too shall pass. And when it does, you'll still be here.*
