You think you have time.

But you don't.

I'm writing this more for me than for you, dear reader. Because I learned this the hard way, and maybe if I put these words out here, they'll stop haunting me at 3 AM. (just maybe.)

We carry words in our chests. Important ones.
And we think we have forever to say them.

## The Clock That Never Stops

Here's the raw truth: every second you're reading this, time is slipping by. Right now. As your eyes move across these words, you're getting older. The people you love are getting older. The moments you're saving for "someday" are fading.

You know that person who makes you feel understood? The one whose laugh you'd recognize anywhere? The one whose presence quietly colors your memories, and whose happiness somehow matters a little more to you than most? The one you think about when good things happen, because they're the first person you want to share with...

What if tomorrow they're not there to tell?

I kept thinking I had all the time in the world. That there would be perfect moments, perfect words, perfect courage. But perfect moments don't exist. Because you know we are imperfect beings. There are only moments. And most of them pass while we're waiting for better ones.

## What Made Me Stay Silent?

Fear. Pure, paralyzing fear.

But not the kind you'd expect. I wasn't afraid of rejection, not really. I was afraid of shattering the beautiful illusion I'd built in my head.

For years, I created stories in my head. Entire conversations we never had. Moments that existed only in my imagination. Some things are only real in the quiet corners of your own mind. (just as pure illusion)

I waited for the perfect moment that never came. The right words that never formed. The courage that always seemed to slip away just when I needed it most.

The people in your life can't read your mind. They don't know their words help you through hard days. They don't know you're grateful for that random Wednesday when they texted you something. They don't know you think about them more than you'd ever admit.

They don't know because you haven't told them, dear reader.

## If You’re Still Waiting, Don’t

You don't need perfect words. You need honest ones.

You don't need the right moment. You need this moment.

That conversation you keep avoiding? Have it today.
That text you've typed and deleted many times? Send it.
That person you need to apologize to? Call them.

## What I realized

<blockquote className="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark" data-dnt="true" align="center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">some words are best spoken before time steals the chance to say them.</p>&mdash; AROICE (@realaroice) <a href="https://twitter.com/realaroice/status/1951606516710035556?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 2, 2025</a></blockquote>

I wrote that quote sitting on the rooftop after realizing I had lost the opportunity to say something important to someone who mattered. 

But here's what I learned: when I finally found the courage to speak those words, even though it was too late for that moment, it felt like breathing again after holding my breath for years.

Life moves faster than we realize. People grow, move cities, drift apart. The comfortable silences turn into awkward distances. The "we should catch up soon" becomes "remember when we used to talk?"

But right now, in this moment, while you're reading this, they might still be here. You're still here. Those words are still waiting.

## What I Need You to Know

Dear reader, this isn't about being dramatic or oversharing or making everything about feelings. This is about being real about how little time we actually have and how much we waste waiting for permission to be human.

Tonight, before you sleep, think of one person who has made your life better. Think of what you would want them to know if tomorrow wasn't guaranteed.

Then tell them. Honestly. That their presence made a difference.

And time, dear reader, doesn't wait for anyone, not even for the most important words you'll ever speak.

*The clock is still ticking. What are you waiting for?*
