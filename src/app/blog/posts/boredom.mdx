*What we actually lost when we eliminated empty moments, and why it matters for creativity*
**I haven't been truly bored in the last few years.**

Not the kind where you stare at the ceiling and your mind starts wandering into strange territories. Not the kind where you suddenly get hit with a random idea that changes everything. Not the kind where you actually sit with yourself and discover what you're really thinking about.

Last week, I tried an experiment. I put my phone in another room and sat on my bed with nothing to do. Within sixty seconds, my brain started screaming. *Check Instagram. Maybe there's an email. What if something important happened? Maybe just one YouTube video to 'relax.'*

The panic was real. Physical. Like my body was going through withdrawal.

And that's when it hit me: **I'm part of the last generation that will remember what boredom actually felt like.**

## The Death of Empty Moments

If you're reading this and you're over 25, you remember boredom. You remember long car rides staring out the window, inventing stories about the houses you passed. You remember lying on your back in the grass, watching clouds and actually *thinking* about stuff that mattered.

But if you're my age (18) or younger? That world is already gone.

A landmark National Institutes of Health study found that children who spent more than two hours a day on screen-time activities scored lower on language and thinking tests, and some children with more than seven hours a day of screen time experienced thinning of the brain's cortex.

Seven hours. That's not even heavy usage anymore - that's Tuesday.

I see 8-year-olds glued to the screen at restaurants. 5-year-olds who know how to navigate TikTok better than their parents know how to navigate their own feelings. We're creating a generation that has never experienced a single moment without stimulation.

And here's what terrifies me: **we have no idea what we're losing.**

## What Actually Happens in Your Brain When You're Bored

This isn't just philosophical bullshit. There's actual science behind why boredom matters.

When we're bored, our brains are relaxed and our usual "filters" are off, which has been scientifically proven to be a precursor for creative thinking. Neuroimaging studies show that during periods of "mind-wandering," the brain's Default Mode Network becomes active - essentially solving problems behind the scenes while you're on autopilot.

Think about it: When do your best ideas come? In the shower. On walks. Right before you fall asleep. Never while you're scrolling through Instagram stories.

Many scientists and artists have reported being inspired or solving complex problems when they stopped thinking about them - this "eureka moment" is called insight, and neuroscientists have shown different patterns of brain activity when people experience these breakthrough moments.

But we've eliminated those spaces. Every potential moment of boredom has been colonized by content. Waiting for the bus? Scroll. Commercial break? Switch apps. Walking somewhere? Podcast time.

We've trained our brains to expect constant stimulation. And when that stimulation stops, we panic. I do.

## The Dopamine Hijacking

Here's where it gets dark.

Excessive screen time triggers dopamine and reward pathways in the brain, leading to deregulation of serotonin and dopamine neurotransmitter pathways in the developing brain, which is associated with online activity abuse and internet addiction.

Research shows that over time, some people's brains can become more sensitive to dopamine triggered by screen activities. The more time spent engaged with these activities, the more they crave them - even when the activity becomes unpleasurable.

That means: **Your phone is literally rewiring your brain to crave distraction.**

Every notification, every red badge, every "someone liked your post" hit triggers a tiny dopamine release. Your brain learns to expect these micro-rewards constantly. When they stop coming (aka when you're bored), your brain interprets this as a problem that needs solving.

So you reach for your phone. And the cycle continues.

## The Creativity Catastrophe

But here's what we're actually losing: **the ability to think original thoughts.**

Emerging research suggests that boredom serves as a catalyst for creativity, self-reflection, and emotional resilience. When you're constantly consuming other people's ideas - through videos, posts, articles, podcasts - when do you have time to develop your own?

We need time to digest. I realized this about myself. I used to have weird, random thoughts all the time.

Now? My internal monologue sounds like a mashup of YouTubers and Twitter threads. Even my "original" thoughts are just remixes of content I've consumed.

**We're becoming intellectual zombies, consuming creativity instead of creating it.**

## The Anxiety Epidemic

And it's not just creativity we're losing - it's mental health.

When you can't be alone with your thoughts without panicking, that's a problem. When the idea of sitting quietly for five minutes feels impossible, that's a problem. When you need constant external validation through likes and comments to feel okay about yourself, that's a fucking problem.

Because the dopamine system reinforces instant gratification, children who frequently engage with screens struggle with delayed reinforcement, self-control, and emotional resilience.

We're raising a generation that can't handle discomfort, can't sit with difficult emotions, and can't function without constant entertainment. What happens when real life gets hard? When relationships require patience? When success takes years of boring, repetitive work?

## The Kids Are Not Alright

This isn't just about adults. Internet addiction causes structural changes in the brain, specifically in the frontal lobe, reducing the ability to filter out irrelevant information and cope with demanding, complex tasks.

I see my 12-year-old cousin, and he can't watch a movie without also being on his mobile. He can't walk to the store without Earphones in. He can't eat dinner without a screen playing something.

He's never experienced silence. He's never been forced to entertain himself with his own mind. He's never had an original thought that wasn't influenced by some algorithm.

**And he's not unusual. He's normal.**

## Fighting Back: What Actually Works

Okay, enough doom. Here's what I've learned actually works (and I've tried everything):

### 1\. Make Boredom Scary, Then Do It Anyway

Put your phone in another room. Set a timer for 10 minutes. Sit there. Don't read, don't write, don't "meditate" - just sit. Your brain will freak out. That's the addiction talking. Push through it.

### 2\. Use Technology Against Itself

I use apps like StayFocusd, One Sec, and ScreenZen to add friction to my digital habits. These apps force a pause before I can open distracting apps. That pause is often enough to break the compulsive cycle.

### 3\. Nuclear Options That Work

* Keep your phone on Do Not Disturb 90% of the time
* Turn off ALL notifications except calls and important texts
* Switch your phone to black and white mode (makes it less stimulating)
* Delete social media apps (use the browser versions if you must)
* Leave your phone at home sometimes. Yes, really.

### 4\. Protect Your Empty Moments

* No podcasts or music during walks sometimes
* No phone in the bathroom (I know, revolutionary)
* Eat meals without any screens
* Take a shower without planning your day

## What We're Really Fighting For

This isn't about being anti-technology. I'm not saying go live in the woods and weave baskets.

**This is about preserving the ability to be human.**

Humans are supposed to have internal lives. We're supposed to get bored and then create something to entertain ourselves. We're supposed to process our experiences, not immediately distract ourselves from them.

The companies that profit from your attention don't care about your creativity, your mental health, or your ability to form original thoughts. They care about engagement metrics and ad revenue. Just pure profits.

But you should care. Because every moment you spend consuming content is a moment you're not creating something, not processing your life, not becoming who you're supposed to become.

## The Choice

Here's the brutal truth: **Most people will never get their attention back.**

They'll spend their entire lives consuming other people's creativity while their own ideas die unborn. They'll never learn to be comfortable with themselves. They'll never know what they actually think about anything because they've never given themselves space to think.

But you don't have to be most people.

You can choose to remember what boredom feels like. You can choose to protect your empty moments. You can choose to be uncomfortable for a few minutes instead of reaching for your phone.

Because on the other side of that discomfort? That's where your actual thoughts live. That's where creativity comes from. That's where you figure out who you really are when no one else is telling you.

**The last generation that will remember boredom doesn't have to be the last generation that experiences it.**

The choice is yours. But you have to make it now.

Before you forget what you're choosing between.

*If this changed something in you while reading it, maybe try sitting with nothing for 10 minutes today. No phone, no book, no music. Just you and your thoughts. See what happens.*

*Also, turn off your notifications. Right now. I'll wait.*

Peace.
