## When Code Calls to You

There are projects you build, and then there are projects that find you. Weekly Commits was the latter.

I discovered this GNOME Shell extension while browsing through GitHub one evening, looking for ways to make my Linux desktop more productive. The concept was beautiful in its simplicity: transform your GitHub contribution activity into a colorful widget that lives right in your desktop's top bar. Seven little boxes, each representing a day of the week, glowing with different intensities based on how many commits you made.

It was like having a tiny piece of GitHub's contribution graph following you everywhere, quietly motivating you to keep coding and keep building.

But as I started using it, I saw potential for something even better.

## The Philosophy of Open Contribution

What drew me to Weekly Commits wasn't just its functionality - it was the philosophy behind it. The original creator, [funinkina](https://github.com/funinkina), had built something that bridged the gap between developer motivation and desktop experience. It turned the abstract concept of "staying consistent with code" into something visual, immediate, and always present.

This wasn't just another productivity tool. It was a gentle reminder system that understood how developers think and work.

As someone who believes that the best software comes from understanding real human needs, I couldn't resist the urge to contribute. Not because the project was broken, but because I could see ways to make it even more delightful to use.

## Making Beautiful Things More Beautiful

My contributions to Weekly Commits focused on three core areas: visual design, user experience, and customization options.

The first thing I tackled was the theming system. While the original extension was functional, I felt it could be more visually appealing and personal. I developed [multiple color themes](https://github.com/funinkina/weekly-commits/pull/4) that went beyond just "light" and "dark" - themes that developers would actually want to stare at every day.

  radius="l"
  border="neutral-alpha-medium"
  aspectRatio="16/9"

/>

Think Halloween oranges and purples for October coding sessions. Dracula theme for late-night development. GitHub's classic green for that authentic contribution graph feel. Each theme wasn't just about different colors; it was about creating moods and personalities for your coding workspace and that maches with your desktop aesthetics.

I also worked on [improving the visual feedback system](https://github.com/funinkina/weekly-commits/pull/5), making the boxes more responsive and intuitive. The goal was simple: when you glance at your top bar, you should immediately understand your coding rhythm for the week without having to think about it.

## The Details That Matter

One of my favorite contributions was [redesigning the logo and visual identity](https://github.com/funinkina/weekly-commits/pull/8) of the project. The original logo was functional, but I felt the project deserved something that captured its essence better - the intersection of code, time, and visual feedback.

  aspectRatio="16/9"
  radius="l"
  src="/images/projects/weekly-commits/weeky-commits-logo-design.jpg"
/>

The new logo reflects the core concept: seven connected elements representing the week, with subtle gradients that hint at the activity visualization. It's the kind of detail that most users might not consciously notice, but it makes the whole experience feel more polished and intentional.

I also focused on [enhancing the configuration experience](https://github.com/funinkina/weekly-commits/pull/7), making it easier for users to set up their GitHub tokens and customize their experience. The technical setup should never be a barrier to enjoying beautiful software.

## Beyond Code: Understanding Users

What made these contributions meaningful wasn't just the code changes - it was understanding what motivates developers on a daily basis.

Developers are visual creatures. We love dashboards, graphs, and metrics that show our progress. But we're also busy people who don't want to constantly check websites or open apps just to see how we're doing.

Weekly Commits solves this perfectly by bringing that visual feedback directly to where developers spend their time: their desktop environment. It's always there, never intrusive, quietly celebrating your productive days and gently nudging you on slower ones.

My contributions aimed to make that experience even more personal and delightful. Because when something is beautiful and personal, you're more likely to pay attention to it. And when you pay attention to your coding habits, you naturally become more consistent.

## The Joy of Collaborative Creation

Working on Weekly Commits taught me something important about open source contribution: it's not just about adding features or fixing bugs. It's about understanding someone else's vision and finding ways to enhance it while respecting what made it special in the first place.

 [Aryan Kushwaha (Funinkina)](https://github.com/funinkina) created something genuinely useful and thoughtful. My job wasn't to rebuild it or redirect it - it was to help it reach its full potential. Every change I made was guided by the question: "Does this make the extension more delightful to use while staying true to its core purpose?"

The creator's appreciation for my contributions meant more than any personal project milestone. It validated that good design and thoughtful user experience improvements can enhance even the most well-conceived projects.

## Making Consistency Visible

At its heart, Weekly Commits is about making abstract concepts concrete. Consistency in coding isn't just about discipline - it's about building momentum, maintaining skills, and staying connected to your craft.

But consistency is hard to measure day-to-day. Did you code enough yesterday? Are you maintaining good habits this week? Traditional metrics require you to actively check them, breaking your focus and workflow.

Weekly Commits changes this by making your coding consistency part of your visual environment. It transforms habit tracking from something you do into something you see.

The themes and visual improvements I added aren't just aesthetic choices - they're about making that visibility more engaging and personal. When your contribution widget matches your desktop theme, when the colors feel right for your mood and time of day, you're more likely to glance at it regularly and internalize the feedback it provides.

## The Bigger Picture

Contributing to Weekly Commits connected me to something larger than individual productivity. It's part of a growing movement of developers who are reimagining how we interact with our tools and workspaces.

Instead of accepting that desktop environments have to be generic and impersonal, projects like this prove we can make them reflect our professional lives and personal aesthetics. Instead of living with software that's "good enough," we can invest time in making it genuinely delightful.

This project represents the intersection of several things I care deeply about: thoughtful design, developer experience, open source collaboration, and the belief that our tools should inspire us rather than just serve us.

## Looking Forward

My work on Weekly Commits isn't finished. I continue to contribute to the project because it feels personal now - not just as a user, but as someone who's helped shape its evolution.

There are more themes to design, more user experience improvements to implement, and more ways to make the extension even more helpful for developers who want to stay motivated and consistent with their coding.

But beyond the specific features, I'm excited about what this collaboration represents: the possibility that small, thoughtful contributions to existing projects can be just as meaningful as building something from scratch.

## Experience It Yourself

Weekly Commits is available on the [GNOME Extensions store](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/8146/weekly-commits/) and open source on [GitHub](https://github.com/funinkina/weekly-commits). If you're a developer using GNOME, it's worth trying - not just for the functionality, but for the daily reminder that consistency and beauty can coexist in our technical tools.

My contributions are visible in several merged pull requests: [theming system improvements](https://github.com/funinkina/weekly-commits/pull/4), [visual feedback enhancements](https://github.com/funinkina/weekly-commits/pull/5), [logo redesign](https://github.com/funinkina/weekly-commits), and [configuration improvements](https://github.com/funinkina/weekly-commits/pull/7).

But more than the code changes, I hope my contributions demonstrate that thoughtful design and user experience improvements can make good software even better, one small enhancement at a time.

Peace.
