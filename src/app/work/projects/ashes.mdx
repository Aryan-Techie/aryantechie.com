# The Problem That Haunts Us All

Picture this: you open a new browser tab. What do you see? Usually nothing meaningful. Maybe bookmarks you never use, or worse, distracting news feeds that pull you into endless scrolling. Meanwhile, something precious slips away unnoticed: your time.

The average person spends over **10 years** of their life just browsing the internet. Ten years. That's a decade of moments that could have been spent creating something meaningful, connecting with people who matter, or simply being present.

I couldn't stop thinking about this. So I built **Ashes**.

# What Ashes Actually Does

Ashes replaces your new tab page with something most people would rather not think about: a **live countdown of your remaining time on Earth**.

Based on your **age** and **country's life expectancy**, it shows you exactly how much time you have left - visualized in **years**, **months**, **days**, **hours**, or **seconds**.

**Sounds morbid?**  
Maybe. But here's what actually happens when you use it: instead of mindlessly opening tabs, you **pause**. Even for just a second.  
That pause creates space for **intention**.

The interface is deliberately minimal:
- No analytics tracking your behavior  
- No ads competing for attention  
- No productivity features promising to optimize your life  

Just clean typography, optional dark mode, and occasionally, a quote from **Marcus Aurelius** or other philosophers who understood that remembering death helps us live better.

# The Philosophy Behind the Code

Ashes isn't really about death. It's about **presence**.

Every time that countdown appears, it's asking you a quiet question:

> "You just opened this tab. You're alive right now. What are you going to do with this moment?"

Most productivity tools try to help you do **more** things faster.  
**Ashes does the opposite**. It helps you question whether you want to do those things at all.

The Romans had a phrase: **_memento mori_** - remember you will die.  
Not to create fear, but to create **clarity**.

When you truly understand that your time is limited, you naturally become more **selective** about how you spend it.

# Building for Intentional Living

The technical implementation was deliberately simple:
- **Vanilla JavaScript**, HTML, and CSS  
- No complex frameworks  
- No external dependencies  
- Works **offline** because your time doesn’t stop when your internet does

All your data stays on your **device**:
- No servers  
- No databases  
- No tracking  

When you enter your birthdate, it’s stored locally in your browser’s storage.  
The calculation happens entirely **on your machine**.  
Privacy isn't a feature here, it's the **foundation**.

I packaged everything using standard web technologies and Chrome Extension & Firefox add-ons APIs to ensure it runs smoothly across different browsers.

The goal was to create something **lightweight** that wouldn’t slow down your browsing, because the last thing you want is a **reminder about your finite time**.

# The Response So Far

Since launching, **Ashes has found its way to people who needed exactly this kind of reminder**.

The feedback has been fascinating:
- Some people uninstall it within hours - it makes them too **uncomfortable**.
- Others keep it and say it's **shifted how they think about their day**.

# What I Learned

Building Ashes taught me that the most powerful interfaces aren't the ones that help you do **more**, but the ones that help you **be more**.

Sometimes the best feature you can add to software is **constraint**.  
Sometimes the most helpful thing you can show someone isn't what they **want** to see, but what they **need** to see.

This project reinforced something I believe deeply:

> **Technology should help us live better, not just faster.**

We don’t need more tools that help us move faster through our lives.  
We need tools that help us **show up more fully for the life we have**.

# Try It Yourself

Ashes is available **free** on the:
- [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ashes-new-tab/ldjabgmogbniabagofffdgkohdeemiim)
- [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ashes-new-tab/)
- [Microsoft Edge Add-ons](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/ashes-new-tab/jaaaiofhkekngalfikbpidbgolncncao)

It takes about **30 seconds** to set up:
1. Enter your birthdate once  
2. Choose your display preferences  
3. That’s it

**Will it make you uncomfortable at first?** Probably.  
**Will it change how you think about time?** Maybe.  
**Will it remind you that every moment, including this one right now, is unrepeatable and precious?**  
Absolutely.

Because the truth is, you could close this browser tab right now and do something completely different with the next few minutes.  
Ashes just makes that choice **visible**.
